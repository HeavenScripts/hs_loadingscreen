## Installation and Usage

To use this loading screen, follow the steps below:

**Project Files**:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the loading screen.
2. `style.css`: The CSS file for styling and visual appearance.
3. `script.js`: The main JavaScript file that manages the loading screen's logic.



**Media Files**:

1. **Video Background**: Ensure you have a video file (e.g., `.webm`) and set it in `index.html` as the source for `<video id="backgroundVideo">`.
2. **Music**: Add your music files (e.g., `.mp3`) to the `assets/` folder. By default, `assets/music1.mp3` is set. Update `musicTracks` in `script.js` if you have multiple tracks.
3. **Logos**: Ensure you have logo images (e.g., `.png`, `.svg`) and set them in `index.html` as the source for `<img class="logo-image">` and `<img class="main-logo-image">`.
